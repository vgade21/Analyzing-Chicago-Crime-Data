# Analyzing-Chicago-Crime-Data

Using data of reported incidents of crime which occurred in the City of Chicago between 2019 and 2022, we analyze recent trends in different types of crimes which occurred in different districts of the city. The purpose of this project is to provide beneficial information and valuable insights to Local Communities and Public Law Enforcement Agencies of Chicago to help mitigate Public Security pressures faced in Chicago.
